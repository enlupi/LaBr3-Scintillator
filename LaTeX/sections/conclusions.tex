\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

 In this work two LaBr scintillating detectors were completely characterised using $^{22}$Na, $^{137}$Cs and $^{60}$Co radioactive sources as references. \\
 First we calibrated them by computing the relation between actual energy and readout channel. Later we studied their energy resolution as a function of the energy and their timing performances. Finally, the efficiency at different energies was studied using different techniques.
