# LaBr3 Scintillators

## Abstract

Scintillation detectors are commonly used for measuring the cross section of reactions relevant in astrophysics, since they provide high efficiencies at the expense of sub-optimal energy resolution and internal background. This work will focus on the complete characterization of a system of two LaBr detectors in terms of energy resolution and efficiency. Time resolution and coincidences will also be investigated.
